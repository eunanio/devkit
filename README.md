# Devkit - WIP
A small library of utility functions that I use a lot. This collection is a work in progress.

## Packages

### FS
Provides filesystem read/write functions.

### Log
Implements a basic multi-writer logger with support for logging to both files and stdout, and includes error handling utilities.

### OCI
Contains the `OciClient` for creating OCI artifacts and basic registry management, including pushing and pulling blobs and manifests, and handling basic authentication.

### System
Includes utilities for system-level operations, such as opening URLs.
